influxdb2-replication-79471652
==============================

This repository contains the code for [my answer][a] to the "question"
[Using Telegraf input for influxdb 2][q].

Usage
-----

```plaintext
git clone https://github.com/mwmahlberg/stackoverflow-answers.git mwmahlberg-so-answers
cd mwmahlberg-so-answers/influxdb2-replication-79471652
make secrets
docker-compose up -d
```

```mermaid
architecture-beta
    group compose(cloud)[yaml]
    service main(database)[Main InfluxDB] in compose
    service replica(database)[Replica] in compose 
    service server(server)[Telegraf] in compose

    server:R --> L:main
    main:R --> L:replica

```


Then, you can [log in to the replica's web interface](http://localhost:8086) and
see the data that is being generated by the telegraf instance in the
[docker-compose.yaml](./docker-compose.yaml) and replicated from the main to the
replica instance.
