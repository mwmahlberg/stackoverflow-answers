# stackoverflow-answers

Code for my answers on StackOverflow.

Over the years, [my profile on StackOverflow][so:mwm] grew, and a lot of answers require code beyond what is feasible to post there.
I created several repositories, but they start to pollute my account.

This repository is an effort to store all code related to my answers on StackOverflow in a single place.
